[Artifact of Entropy]

## Numerical seed that strictly defines the outcome to action links for the run. An input of -1 creates a random seed.A run seed is printed both in chat and in the Debug Log at the start of each stage in this format: (Artifact of Entropy Seed): num This seed can be shared with other players so they can experience your run!. Note: To produce an identical run, settings have to match, or some things may be different. 
## Range: (-2,147,483,647, 2,147,483,647)
## Default: -1
# Setting type: String
# Default value: -1
Generation Seed = -1

## This is a multiplier for the likelihood of an event (ex: summoning a random monster) to link itself to an individual action (ex: player damaging a monster) upon starting the game. It does not affect its assigned probability of each event occuring, only the average quantity of event to action links. 
## Range: (0.0-inf) 
## Default: 1.0
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 1.0
Event Hook Multiplier = 1.0

## Multiplies the percentage chance of all events. If an event with a 30% chance had this setting at 2.0, its new probability would then be 60%. Applied BEFORE the offset. 
## Range: (0.0-inf)
## Default: 1.0
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 1.0
Event Chance Multiplier = 1.0

## Adds a fixed percentage chance to all events. If an event with a 27% chance to occur had this setting at -25.0, its new probability would then be 2%. 
## Range: (-100.0, 100.0) 
## Default: 0.00
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0
Event Chance Offset = 0

## All Events under the same action will occur at the same time.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Simultaneous Outcomes = false

[Artifact of Smash]

## Multiplier for damage done to enemies via impact. 
## Range: (0, 5) 
## Default: 1
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 1
Enemy Impact Dmg Mult. = 1

## Multiplier for damage done to survivors via impact. 
## Range: (0, 5) 
## Default: 1
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 1
Player Impact Dmg Mult. = 1

[Artifact of The Titans]

## How much monsters scale to credit cost (linear). Doesn't apply to teleporter bosses. 
## Range: (0, 4) 
## Default: 0.15
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0.15
Credit Scaling = 0.15

## The exponential growth of bosses per stage (max 10 stages). This setting can produce some dramatic differences with small changes. 
## Range: (-0.15, 5) 
## Default: 2.60
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 2.6
Boss Growth = 2.6

## Applies an additional scaling factor to elite enemies and bosses. 
## Range: (0, 4) 
## Default: 0.40
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0.4
Elite Multiplier = 0.4

## An unchanging value to additionaly scale to all non-Boss monsters. For example, a beetle guard would normally be scaled to a factor of 3.4. 
## Range: (0, 10) 
## Default: 0
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0
Fixed Monster Scale = 0

## An unchanging value to additionaly scale to all Boss monsters. This setting is sensitive. 
## Range: (0, 10) 
## Default: 0
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0
Fixed Boss Scale = 0

[Artifact of War]

## Base value for the player to get an item on a monster kill. Scales exponentially in later stages. 
## Range: (0, 100) 
## Default: 5
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 5
Base Item Droprate = 5

## Exponent that increases the base droprate value per stage. 
## Range: (0, 4) 
## Default: 1.4
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 1.4
Droprate Exp. Scaling = 1.4

## Exponent that increases the amount of items given to monsters. (Scales with time/stage). 
## Range: (0, 4) 
## Default: 2.4
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 2.4
Monster Item Scaling = 2.4

## Total Time (in minutes) it takes to increment the swarm multiplier by 1. 
## Default: 5
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 5
Swarm Multiplier Timer = 5

## Highest amount of monsters that can spawn per director spawn (swarm effect). 
## Range: (0.0-inf) 
## Default: 5
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 5
Monster Swarm Cap = 5

## Max amount of monsters that can exist on a stage at once. 
## Range: (0.0-inf) 
## Default: 250
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 250
Monster Count Cap = 250
